# Twitter-Machine
## Projet overview:
Software engineering : Twitter Machine that retrieves all social data of users.

I wrote this pipeline of code during the first few weeks of my internship, as summer intern for Sage Digital, in Palo Alto. <br/>
It retrieves all social data from Twitter user's account and add it to a SQL Database. <br/>
I also design the DB structure that goes with it, with the help of Nick Hirning, student in Stanford. <br/>
Users' social data are collected through Twitter DEV API: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index.html
